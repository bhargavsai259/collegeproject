| Wall Color Extraction  | Segmentation          | Mask R-CNN, DeepLab: Segment walls          | Identifies walls to extract dominant colors for rectangular room surfaces. |
|                        | Color Extraction      | Extract dominant colors from segments       | Applies colors to walls in the 3D render for visual fidelity.              |
| Furniture Detection    | Object Detection      | YOLO, Faster R-CNN, Detectron2: Find items  | Locates furniture in images for 2D placement on floor plane.               |
|                        | Furniture Mapping     | Map detected furniture to types             | Assigns categories (e.g., chair) for 2D placement.                         |
| 2D Floor Layout        | Floor Layout          | Place objects on 2D plane                   | Creates 2D layout with breadth/length positions, no height/depth.          |
| 3D Export              | Scene Export          | Export 3D scene to GLTF format              | Allows users to save/download the 3D model for external use or sharing.    |
